Project_title: Word Puzzle

Purpose: The purpose of this program is to create a word puzzle game where the user is given a word and they have to guess the word by entering a letter at a time.
The user has a limited number of guesses to guess the word.
I've added, a list of secret words, randomly selected secret word, hint based on the user's guess, feedback message to the user, game over message if the user runs out of attempts and A congratulatory message if the user guesses the word correctly
